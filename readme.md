# Welcome to your first GitHub repository

This is how you will be submitting work for this class, and (hopefully) for AP Computer Science next year.

GitHub is a system for _version control_, kind of like Google Drive for code.

You will be manually adding files this year, but in the future, you will be using Advanced Coding Stuff<sup>TM</sup> to add your work.

You should have a GitHub account that looks like <code>FirstnameLastname</code> or <code>firstname-lastname</code>. This is so that I can identify you work. Please DO NOT have a username like <code>emojiPanda3000</code>, because I won't know that it's you.
