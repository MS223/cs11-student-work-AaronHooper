# Welcome to your first GitHub repository

This is how you will be submitting work for this class, and (hopefully) for AP Computer Science next year.

GitHub is a system for _version control_, kind of like Google Drive for code.

You will be manually adding files this year, but in the future, you will be using Advanced Coding Stuff<sup>TM</sup> to add your work.
